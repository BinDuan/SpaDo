## Overview
In this study, we introduce SpaDo, a tool that facilitates cross-slice spatial domain alignment, detection, annotation, and downstream analysis for spatial transcriptome data at single-cell and spot resolutions. SpaDo encompasses the following functionalities: (1) spatial domain alignment and detection of multi-slice spatial domain, (2) reference-based spatial domain annotation, and (3) calculation of slice-level similarity and cross-slice clustering analysis.

## Installation
* **SpaDo** package can be installed from Github using **devtools** packages with **R>=4.0.5**.

    ```r
    library(devtools)
    install_github("bm2-lab/SpaDo")
    ```
